Hi again!  It's a [new year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah),
[in an old house, with more technology I'll never
understand](https://seeming.bandcamp.com/track/new-year).  But amidst all
the chaos of the seasons changing, AWS being unfathomable to me, and Alexx
Reed being about 50% smarter of a lyricist than I'll ever understand all the
references to, I have exciting news, and that is: for the first time in over
a year, there is a brand new app for Pebbles in a Pebble app store!

If you've been following along on Reddit or on Discord (shoutouts to our
loyal fans!), you might have heard that
[Wowfunhappy](https://github.com/Wowfunhappy/)
has recently written an RSS reader app for Pebble.  This is really cool in a
lot of ways -- he did a _bang-up_ job on the UI for it, and people on Reddit
are already finding great uses for it, enabling things that they weren't
previously able to do on their Pebbles (like check work schedules that came
as RSS feeds).  And, of course, he released it entirely as [open source
software](https://github.com/Wowfunhappy/Pebble-RSS-Reader), which
definitely speaks to me.

The fact that it's a cool project I think is a great reason to highlight it
here.  But the reason I wanted to tell you about this is that this also
marks a milestone of _the first time we've added a new app to the Rebble App
Store since the very first time we imported the Pebble App Store's
contents_.  I spent a few hours last week working with Jonathan to get this
all set up, and I'm pleased to announce that the Rebble App Store is
(mostly) open for submissions!  [Here's some directions for how to do
that](https://github.com/pebble-dev/wiki/wiki/Preparing-a-new-app-for-the-Rebble-App-Store),
if you've got some Pebble apps burning a hole in your hard disk, or if
you're ready for the creative juices to start flowing.  The process is a
little janky right now, but I'm definitely happy to help however I can --
and there are lots of us in #app-dev on Discord ready to answer questions!

It's a new day in Pebble app development.  Let's see what you've got --
here's wishing all of us Rebblers an appy new year!
